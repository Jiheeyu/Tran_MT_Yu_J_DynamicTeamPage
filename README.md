# Dynamic Team Page

## Create a page to show bio of members in FIP team

### Prerequisites
1. On Design: 
- Come up with a design to display only one team member at a time: we are going with something minimalistic and modern-looking.
- Page is designed to be displayed in full-width, to try it out, clone this project to a specific folder and open the `index.html` with a browser (may prefer to be [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)).

2. On Features:
- Buttons to navigate to two different sections for each member.
- Information is held in an array and called out through multiple tags.
